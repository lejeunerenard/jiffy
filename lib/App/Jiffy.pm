=head1 NAME

App::Jiffy - A minimalist time tracking app focused on precision and effortlessness.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use App::Jiffy;

  # cmd line tool
  jiffy Solving world hunger
  jiffy Cleaning the plasma manifolds
  jiffy current # Returns the elapsed time for the current task

  # Run server
  jiffyd
  curl -d "title=Meeting with Client X" http://localhost:3000/timeentry

=head1 DESCRIPTION

App::Jiffy's philosophy is that you should have to do as little as possible to track your time. Instead you should focus on working. App::Jiffy also focuses on precision. Many times time tracking results in globbing activities together masking the fact that your 5 hours of work on project "X" was actually 3 hours of work with interruptions from your coworker asking about project "Y".

In order to be precise with as little effort as possible, App::Jiffy will be available via a myriad of mediums and devices but will have a central server to combine all the information. Plans currently include the following applications:

=over

=item Command line tool

=item Web app L<App::Jiffyd>

=item iPhone app ( potentially )

=back

=head1 INSTALLATION

  curl -L https://cpanmin.us | perl - git://github.com/lejeunerenard/jiffy

=head1 METHODS

The following are methods available on the C<App::Jiffy> object.

=head2 add_entry

C<add_entry> will create a new TimeEntry with the current time as the entry's start_time.

=cut

=head2 current_time

C<current_time> will print out the elapsed time for the current task (AKA the time since the last entry was created).

=cut

=head2 time_sheet

C<time_sheet> will print out a time sheet including the time spent for each C<TimeEntry>.

=cut

=head2 run

C<run> will start an instance of the Jiffy app.
