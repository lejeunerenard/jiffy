# NAME

App::Jiffy - A minimalist time tracking app focused on precision and effortlessness.

# SYNOPSIS

    use App::Jiffy;
    # cmd line tool to come

# DESCRIPTION

App::Jiffy's philosophy is that you should have to do as little as possible to track your time. Instead you should focus on working. App::Jiffy also focuses on precision. Many times time tracking results in globbing activities together masking the fact that your 5 hours of work on project "X" was actually 3 hours of work with interruptions from your coworker asking about project "Y".

In order to be precise with as little effort as possible, App::Jiffy will be available via a myriad of mediums and devices but will have a central server to combine all the information. Plans currently include the following applications:

- Command line tool
- Web app
- iPhone app ( potentially )
